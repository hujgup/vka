Command structure is a set of select boxes or text input fields
So "move to room x" would be like
Menu 1 -> Select "Move"
Menu 2 appears
Menu 2 -> Select "RESIDENTIAL CORRIDOR ALPHA"
Confirm button appears
Click confirm button
On move action happens

Localization string styling:
[+c pesterlog vriska]AG: 8[/c]
Would result in the following HTML:
<span class="pesterlog vriska">AG: 8</span>
And those classas can be defined in some file in style/app

Make sure that COM string escaping is handled properly (i.e. anything after \ is a literal unless it's \n, in which case it's \n)

Copy over global.css into project folder and modify index references
