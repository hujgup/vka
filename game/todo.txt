Conbination moduses

Command structure is a set of select boxes or text input fields
So "move to room x" would be like
Menu 1 -> Select "Move"
Menu 2 appears
Menu 2 -> Select "RESIDENTIAL CORRIDOR ALPHA"
Confirm button appears
Click confirm button
On move action happens

(Since this deprecates the old movement control area, repurpose that space for the quest log)

Localization string styling:
[+c pesterlog vriska]AG: 8[/c]
Would result in the following HTML:
<span class="pesterlog vriska">AG: 8</span>
And those classas can be defined in some file in style/app

COM: Make sure all strings are stored as COM.Strings

Copy over global.css into project folder and modify index references
